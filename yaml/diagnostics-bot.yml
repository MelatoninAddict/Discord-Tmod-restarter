              \nDiscrepancies in unicorn image and metadata usually happens when the unicorn is undergoing metadata transition (e.g. updating from Baby to Adult). Wait for at least an hour for the transition to complete. After an hour has passed you may check if the transition is complete by going to the Hawku/OpenSea page of your unicorn. In OpenSea, you have the option to refresh the metadata of your unicorn to update it on OpenSea's end.

        text: "If the image and the lifecycle metadata of your unicorn do not match, it is important that you **do not unlock the unicorn** out of the game as it is going to be put in a bad state. Furthermore, if the bugged unicorn is showing as \"Locked\" in-game but is showing as \"Unlocked\" in Hawku/OpenSea, **do not unlock the bugged unicorn** out of the game because this is going to put the unicorn in a bad state.
              \n
              \nDiscrepancies in unicorn image and metadata usually happens when the unicorn is undergoing metadata transition (e.g. updating from Baby to Adult). Wait for at least an hour for the transition to complete. After an hour has passed you may check if the transition is complete by going to the Hawku/OpenSea page of your unicorn. In OpenSea, you have the option to refresh the metadata of your unicorn to update it on OpenSea's end.
              \n
              \nIf the bug persists, or if you have a unicorn that has inconsistent image and metadata that has been going on for more than an hour and cannot be solved by refreshing metadata, create a ticket on our Zendesk."
